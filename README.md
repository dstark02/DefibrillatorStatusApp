## Synopsis
Defibrillator Status App is an iOS application to be run on iPhone and iPad (Primarily iPhone) installed with iOS10. This application aims to give comprehensive information relating to Sudden Cardiac Arrests events in which a HeartSine defibrillator was used. The data for this application is to be mocked as HeartSine are still in developmental stage of new defibrillator device.

## Motivation
Currently, HeartSine's current data-management PC application does not get the appropriate use to keep supporting it. Therefore, I am developing a solution that will fit into today's technology market.  The users of this system will include:

Paramedics – They cannot use HeartSine's current data-management application as it is a PC application. However, they want to find out more information about the event when they have got to the patient and have them in the ambulance so that they can facilitate them further. This would be possible with this solution.

Patient - The person who had the cardiac arrest so they can facilitate physician oversight (i.e. after hospital discharge).

HeartSine – They rely on survivors who have used their products to submit event data so they can continually improve their products. At the moment, with their current PC application they are not getting the response justified to keep supporting it. With this solution the user could simply upload their event through the app to a HeartSine server which HeartSine could then retrieve.
